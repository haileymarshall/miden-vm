//! A high-performance sparse merkle tree forest with pluggable backends.
//!
//! # Semantic Layout
//!
//! Much like `SparseMerkleTree`, the forest stores trees of depth 64 that use the compact leaf
//! optimization to uniquely store 256-bit elements. This reduces both the size of a merkle path,
//! and the computational work necessary to perform queries into the trees.
//!
//! # Storing Trees and Versions
//!
//! The usage of an SMT forest is conceptually split into two parts: a collection that is able to
//! store **multiple, unrelated trees**, and a container for **multiple versions of those trees**.
//! Both of these use-cases are supported by the forest, but have an explicit delineation between
//! them in both the API and the implementation. This has two impacts that a client of the forest
//! must understand.
//!
//! - While, when using a [`Backend`] that can persist data, **only the current full tree state is
//!   persisted**, while **the historical data will not be**. This is designed into the structure of
//!   the forest, and does not depend on the choice of storage backend.
//! - It is more expensive to query a given tree at an older point in its history than it is to
//!   query it at a newer point, and querying at the current tree will always take the least time.
//!
//! # Lineages
//!
//! We term a set of trees where each is derived from the previous version to be a **lineage**. A
//! single lineage semantically contains the **full information** on the current state of the tree,
//! alongside a set of deltas which describe how to change that full tree to return to a historical
//! state of that tree.
//!
//! While any given [`Backend`] may choose to share data between lineages, this behavior is not
//! guaranteed, and must not be relied upon.
//!
//! # Tree Identification
//!
//! It is possible for multiple lineages to contain a tree with identical leaves and hence an
//! identical root. As we store lineages separately, we need some way to specify which instance of a
//! given root we mean.
//!
//! This is done by identifying trees using the [`TreeId`], which combines the tree's root value
//! with a user-provided identifier that tags the tree with a 'domain'. This allows distinguishing
//! between otherwise identical trees. Users must take care to ensure that each domain is unique, as
//! reusing them will result in overwriting data in the wrong domain, and that queries may return
//! incorrect results.
//!
//! # Data Storage
//!
//! The SMT forest is parametrized over the [`Backend`] implementation that it uses. These backends
//! may have significantly varied performance characteristics, and hence any performance analysis of
//! the forest should be done in conjunction with a specific backend. The forest itself takes pains
//! to not make any assumptions about properties of the backend in use.
//!
//! Take care to read the documentation of the specific [`Backend`] that you are planning to use in
//! order to understand its performance, gotchas, and other such details.

// SPARSE MERKLE TREE FOREST
// ================================================================================================

/// A high-performance forest of sparse merkle trees with pluggable storage.
///
/// # Current and Frozen Trees
///
/// Trees in the forest fall into two categories:
///
/// 1. **Current:** These trees represent the latest version of their 'tree lineage' and can be
///    modified to generate a new tree version in the forest.
/// 2. **Frozen:** These are historical versions of trees that are no longer current, and are
///    considered 'frozen' and hence cannot be modified to generate a new tree version in the
///    forest. This is because being able to do so would effectively create a "fork" in the history,
///    and hence allow the forest to yield potentially invalid responses with regard to the
///    blockchain history.
///
/// The API is designed to avoid any possibility of modifying frozen trees in the forest, and hence
/// ensure the correctness of the history stored in the forest.
///
/// # Performance
///
/// The performance characteristics of this forest depend heavily on the choice of underlying
/// [`Backend`] implementation. Where something more specific can be said about a particular method
/// call, the documentation for that method will state it.
