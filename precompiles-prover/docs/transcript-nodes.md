# Transcript node formats

Cross-chiplet protocol layer: how values and assertions are committed
inside the transcript DAG. Defines the 12-felt hash preimage shape and
the tag / version / parameter discipline that gives each node its
domain separation across the chunk, Keccak, uint, and EC paths.

Adapted from the precompile-VM design doc (trunk's `pvm-design.md`,
§3 / §4 / §6.3 / §6.7 / §7.1 / §8.4 / §8.5). The cherry-picked
scope here covers the Keccak node types — **Chunk** and **Keccak** —
plus the live uint family: **Transcript** / **UintLeaf** / **UintOp**;
the EC family: **EcCreate**, **EcBinOp**, and **EcMsm**.

The Keccak MVP follows VM deferred-state tags for the public root path:
**AND** is VM `Tag::AND = [1, 0, 0, 0]`, generic chunk commitments use
VM `Tag::CHUNKS = [2, 0, 0, 0]`, and the terminal Keccak assertion uses
`Keccak256Precompile::assert_tag(len_bytes).as_word() =
[Keccak256Precompile::id(), 0, len_bytes, 0]`. Non-Keccak uint/EC
families still use prover-local `NodeTag` + `CURRENT_VERSION` caps.

## Hash preimage — Miden-native 12-felt state

Every node in the transcript DAG is committed via a Poseidon2-f[12]
hash whose input is laid out in Miden's native `[RATE, CAPACITY]`
order. This lets a Poseidon2 chiplet call ingest the preimage
without any felt reshuffling.

```
index:  0 ................ 7        8        9        10       11
        val[8]                      tag_id   param_a  param_b  version
        ────── rate ──────          ─────────── capacity ─────────────
```

- **`val[8]`** (positions 0–7, rate): node-shape-specific payload.
  For composite nodes (e.g. tags reserved for future expansion)
  this is `lhs_hash[4] || rhs_hash[4]`. For `Chunk` it is an
  8-felt payload chunk; Keccak digest bytes use this same shape as a
  semantic one-chunk commitment.
- **`tag_id`** (position 8, capacity): node type discriminator.
- **`param_a`**, **`param_b`** (positions 9, 10): node-shape
  parameters (semantics per tag — see [§ Tag enumeration](#tag-enumeration)).
- **`version`** (position 11): fixed felt constant `CURRENT_VERSION`.
  Every consumer rejects any node where the version doesn't match.
  Bumping the version invalidates all prior commitments — the
  upgrade lever.

The node's hash is `Poseidon2(preimage)[0..4]` — the first rate
word post-permutation, matching the existing Poseidon2 chiplet's
`DIGEST_RANGE` convention.

## `CURRENT_VERSION`

A felt-valued global constant baked into every chiplet that
participates in transcript hashing. Initial value: `0` (placeholder
— lock the exact felt once the chiplet stack stabilizes and a
"version 1" cut is appropriate). Future spec upgrades increment
this constant, which forces every previously-committed transcript
root to fail verification against the new code path.

The version lives in the capacity slot `state[11]` so it's bound
into every node's hash without consuming a rate slot.

## Tag enumeration

VM-owned caps are sourced through
[`src/transcript/deferred_tags.rs`](../src/transcript/deferred_tags.rs).
The remaining local caps are registered in
[`src/transcript/nodes.rs`](../src/transcript/nodes.rs) (`NodeTag` enum +
`CURRENT_VERSION`).

| Capacity word | Name | `val[8]` |
|---|---|---|
| `[1, 0, 0, 0]` | VM `AND` | `lhs_hash[4] \|\| rhs_hash[4]` |
| `[2, 0, 0, 0]` | VM `CHUNKS` | per-chunk content, including one-chunk digest payloads |
| `[Keccak256Precompile::id(), 0, len_bytes, 0]` | VM Keccak-256 assertion | `H_input_chunks[4] \|\| H_digest_chunks[4]` |
| `[UintLeaf, bound_ptr, pin_ptr, CURRENT_VERSION]` | local UintLeaf | the uint's 8×u32-LE value |
| `[UintOp, op_id, 0, CURRENT_VERSION]` | local UintOp | `lhs_hash[4] \|\| rhs_hash[4]` |
| `[EcCreate, a_ptr, b_ptr, CURRENT_VERSION]` | local EcCreate | `x_hash[4] \|\| y_hash[4]` |
| `[EcBinOp, op_id, 0, CURRENT_VERSION]` | local EcBinOp | `P_hash[4] \|\| Q_hash[4]` |
| `[EcMsm, group_ptr, 0, CURRENT_VERSION]` | local EcMsm IV | first MSM absorb; later absorbs use the prior digest as cap |

### Parameter constraints

Every node-evaluating chiplet enforces these unused-slot pins as
local AIR constraints. The pins are part of the version-1 spec —
violating them is rejected as a malformed node, distinct from a
version mismatch.

- **Tags 0, 1**: `param_a = 0`, `param_b = 0`.
- **Tag 2**: `param_a = bound_ptr` (never 0 — ptr 0 is not a store
  address), `param_b = pin_ptr` (`is_pinned·ptr`: the store address
  of a pinned leaf, 0 for a transient).
- **Tag 4**: `param_a = op_id ∈ [1, 5]`, `param_b = 0`. Both param
  slots belong to the op-discriminant namespace; future per-op
  parameters land in `param_b`.
- **Tag 5**: `param_a = a_ptr`, `param_b = b_ptr` — the store
  addresses of the curve's pinned `a`, `b` (never 0). This is the
  only node where the curve `(a, b)` enters the DAG.
- **Tag 6**: `param_a = op_id ∈ [1, 4]`, `param_b = 0` — uniform
  with tag 4: no curve param in the cap, the curve threads
  transitively through the operands' hashes.
- **Tag 7**: `param_b = 0` (param_a is `len_bytes`, unconstrained
  here — the Keccak chip enforces its own range via the
  `n_chunks = ⌈len_bytes / 32⌉` relationship).

### Tag 1 (Chunk) — not an eval-chip node

Tag 1 is the generic chunk capacity domain separator, not an eval-chip
dispatch row. The chunk chiplet uses it when starting an absorption
chain over input chunks: capacity init is
`state[8..12] = (1, 0, 0, CURRENT_VERSION)`. KeccakNode also uses the
same capacity inline to hash the 8 packed digest felts as a semantic
one-chunk payload. That digest commitment is not a physical extra
ChunkAir row.

### Tag 3 (unused)

Tag id 3 is intentionally unassigned. Current KeccakNode hashing commits
both input bytes and digest bytes with tag 1 (`Chunk`), then commits the
terminal assertion with tag 7 (`Keccak`).

### Tag 4 (UintOp)

A uint arithmetic / equality node over two child hashes,
discriminated by `param_a = op_id` (registered in code as
`UintOpId`, `src/transcript/nodes.rs`):

| `op_id` | op | children (lhs, rhs) | semantics |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Add` | a, b | `r = a + b mod p` |
| 2 | `Sub` | a, b | `r = a − b mod p` |
| 3 | `Mul` | a, b | `r = a · b mod p` |
| 4 | `Neg` | a, `0⁴` | `r = −a mod p` (unary; the rhs slot is pinned zero) |
| 5 | `Is`  | a, b | assert `a ≡ b`, binds `True` |

The value ops bind `(h, Uint, r_ptr, bound_ptr)`; `Is` binds
`(h, True, 0, 0)` — the predicate that folds uint equalities into the
transcript root. **No result ptr appears in the cap**: the result ptr
is a nondeterministic witness riding the Binding bus, and the bound is
threaded through the lookups — the children's bindings, the relation
tuple, and the node's own binding all carry one shared `bound_ptr`.

Each value-op row consumes one **pointered relation tuple** from
the matching relation chiplet — `UintAdd(bound_ptr, ·, ·, ·)` for
`Add` / `Sub` (the arrangement `b + r = a`) / `Neg` (the
`is_c_zero` form, `c_ptr = 0`), `UintMul(1, 0, a, b, bound_ptr,
r, bound_ptr)` for `Mul` — which is where all value soundness
lives; the eval row is pure ptr wiring. `Is` consumes no relation:
it reads both children's bindings through one shared ptr column,
so equality is enforced by bus balance alone.

### Tag 5 (EcCreate)

The EC family's leaf: a composite node that constructs a point of
the short-Weierstrass curve `y² = x³ + ax + b` from two uint-node
children `(x, y)`. The curve is named by the cap — `param_a = a_ptr`,
`param_b = b_ptr`, the store addresses of the pinned `a` and `b` —
and the modulus `p` is inherited from the children's shared
`bound_ptr`.

`x = y = 0` (both children the zero uint) denotes the **point at
infinity** — the group's canonical PAI row, bound with `is_pai = 1`.

Binds `(h, Group, point_ptr)`. The row consumes both children's `Uint`
bindings, one `EcGroup(group, a_ptr, b_ptr, bound_ptr, …)` tuple tying
the cap's `a` / `b` to the point's group, and the point's
`EcPoint(point_ptr, group, x_ptr, y_ptr, is_pai)` membership tuple.

### Tag 6 (EcBinOp)

A point operation over child hashes, discriminated by
`param_a = op_id`:

| `op_id` | op | children (lhs, rhs) | `EcGroupAdd` arrangement | binds |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Add` | P, Q | `(g, p, q) = r` | `(h, Group, r)` |
| 2 | `Sub` | P, Q | `(g, r, q) = p`  (so `r + q = p`) | `(h, Group, r)` |
| 3 | `Neg` | P, `0⁴` | `(g, p, r) = pai`  (so `p + r = ∞`) | `(h, Group, r)` |
| 4 | `Is`  | P, Q | — | `(h, True)` |

Uniform with `UintOp`: **no curve param in the cap** — the curve
threads through the operands' `Group` binding hashes and is pinned by
the `EcGroupAdd` provide. `Add` / `Sub` / `Neg` each consume one
`EcGroupAdd` tuple — the arrangements mirror uint's `a + b = c` /
`b + r = a` / `a + r = 0`, where all value soundness lives; the eval
row is pure ptr wiring. `Is` consumes no relation: both children's
`Group` bindings read through one shared `point_ptr`, so equality is
enforced by bus balance alone, and binds `True` to fold the result into
the transcript root.

### Tag 7 (Keccak)

A fused terminal assertion node handled by the KeccakNode chiplet, not by a
separate eval-chip row. The node hashes:

```text
H_keccak = H(
    rate = H_input_chunks[4] || H_digest_chunks[4],
    cap  = [Keccak, len_bytes, 0, V],
)
```

KeccakNode proves that `H_digest_chunks` binds the squeezed digest limbs and that
`H_input_chunks` is the content commitment for the absorbed chunks, then provides
`Binding(H_keccak, True, 0, 0)` directly. Digest and chunks do not enter the
current `Binding` bus as reusable value variants.

## Value variants and Binding

Bindings associate a 4-felt hash with a typed value. The variants
registered in code (`src/transcript/binding.rs`):

| `value_tag` | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `True` | — (an assertion that holds) |
| 1 | `Uint` | `ptr`, `bound_ptr` |
| 2 | `Group` | `point_ptr` |

The pvm-design's `KeccakDigest` / `Chunks` value variants are
deliberately absent — the Keccak path fuses and never puts them on
the Binding bus (see [`transcript-eval.md`](transcript-eval.md)
§"Why Keccak fuses"); their pvm-design shapes are kept below for
the record.

| pvm value kind | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | `KeccakDigest` | `ptr` |
| 4 | `Chunks` | `n_chunks`, `ptr` |

### Pointer semantics

Pointers are **opaque felt-valued identifiers owned by the
respective chiplet**. The producing chiplet enforces
**canonical pointer assignment**: distinct underlying values get
distinct pointers, equal underlying values get the same pointer.
This is the foundation that lets `Eq`-style consumers compare
values by pointer equality alone.

The pvm-design chunk/digest variants used a shared chunk pointer. In this repo's
current fused Keccak path, chunk and sponge sequence ids stay inside the
Chunk/Keccak buses, and KeccakNode exposes only the terminal
`Binding(H_keccak, True, 0, 0)` assertion.

### Binding bus tuple

The bus that landed is **width-7**: `(h0, h1, h2, h3, value_tag,
ptr, bound_ptr)`, with unused positions pinned to zero. `h[4]` is the
4-felt hash output of the node (= `Poseidon2(preimage)[0..4]`) that
binds this value into the transcript tree; `ptr` is the canonical value
handle of a value-binding; `bound_ptr` names a uint value's modulus.

| Variant | `h[4]` | `value_tag` | `ptr` | `bound_ptr` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `True` | node hash | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| `Uint` | node hash | 1 | the stored uint's ptr | its modulus's ptr |
| `Group` | node hash | 2 | the stored point's ptr | 0 |

The Binding bus is registered in
[`src/relations.rs`](../src/relations.rs) as `BusId::Binding = 8`,
owned by the transcript eval chip (self-referential: it provides
each node's binding and consumes its children's), with one
exception — `KeccakNodeAir` fuses and provides its own
`Binding(H_keccak, True, 0, 0)`. Domain separation from the other
buses is the usual bus-prefix mechanism.
